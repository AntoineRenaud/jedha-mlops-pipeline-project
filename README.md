# jedha-mlops-pipeline-project

## Description

This project involves developing a complete MLOps pipeline to automate the lifecycle of a machine learning model.

Find & Prepare Data: Select a challenging, real-world dataset and preprocess it, including handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
Train a Model: Choose an appropriate algorithm, train the model using tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn, and evaluate its performance.

Build MLOps Pipeline:

  - Deployment: Deploy the model with Docker or Kubernetes, and expose it via a REST API.
  - CI/CD: Automate model deployment using CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
  - Monitoring & Logging: Use tools to monitor metrics like accuracy, latency, and drift detection in production.
  - Automated Retraining: Set up retraining pipelines that trigger when new data arrives or model performance degrades.
  - Versioning & Rollback: Utilize tools like DVC or MLflow for model versioning and rollback.
  - API Development: Create well-documented APIs for integrating the model with other systems.
